 ## How to Clone This GitHub Project

This README provides instructions on how to clone this GitHub project to your local machine.

**Prerequisites:**

* Git installed on your local machine
* A command prompt or terminal

**Cloning the Project:**

There are two main methods for cloning the project:

**1. Using HTTPS URL:**

1. **Open the project page on GitHub.**
2. Click the **Code** button and copy the **HTTPS URL**.
3. Open a **command prompt** or **terminal** on your local machine.
4. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.
5. Run the following command, replacing `<URL>` with the copied HTTPS URL:

```
git clone <https://github.com/developer-in-world/Delaney-Solubility.git>
```

This command will download the project files to your local machine and create a new directory for the project.

**2. Using SSH URL:**

1. **Open the project page on GitHub.**
2. Click the **Code** button and choose the **SSH** option.
3. Copy the displayed **SSH URL**.
4. Open a **command prompt** or **terminal** on your local machine.
5. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.
6. Run the following command, replacing `<URL>` with the copied SSH URL:

```
git clone <git@github.com:developer-in-world/Delaney-Solubility.git>
```

This command will download the project files to your local machine and create a new directory for the project.

**Additional Notes:**

* If the project is private, you will need to be logged in to your GitHub account before you can clone it.
* You can specify a specific branch or commit to download using the `-b` or `-c` flags with the `git clone` command.
* For more information on using Git, you can refer to the official Git documentation: [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/)

**After Cloning:**

Once you have cloned the project, you can access and use it like any other project on your local machine. You can use your preferred code editor or IDE to open and modify the files, and you can run any scripts or programs that are included in the project.

**Contributing to the Project:**

If you would like to contribute to this project, you can fork the repository and create a pull request. Please refer to the project's contribution guidelines for more information.

**Happy coding!**
 
 ## Delaney solubility
 
 Delaney solubility, also known as ESOL (Estimated SOLubility), is a method for estimating the aqueous solubility of a compound directly from its molecular structure. The model was derived from a set of 2874 measured solubilities using linear regression against nine molecular properties.

This data is often used in the field of data science, particularly in machine learning, to predict compound solubility. For example, itâ€™s used in Kaggle competitions and in projects on GitHub for solubility prediction. This allows researchers and data scientists to build models that can predict the solubility of new, untested compounds, which is very useful in fields like drug discovery.


I have used Google Colab for model training. You can use the model directly in your Colab and train it, or even train it locally on your machine.
